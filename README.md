# Jets Project

# Description
This is my third project while at Skill Distillery. The project is a user application designed around looking at a fleet of different types of jets. The user is prompted with a menu with the given options: List the fleet, fly all jets, view the fastest jet, view the jet with the longest range, load all cargo jets, fight with fighter planes, the ability to add a jet to the fleet, remove a jet from the fleet and finally the option to quit the application. 
# What I Learned
This project was difficult on the learning curve due to the concepts of ArrayLists, abstract classes, inheritance and encapsulation. I do feel more comfortable working with this object oriented project and language. I will keep practicing in the hopes of mastering these concepts.
# Technologies Used
I used Git, Eclipse, Java and the Terminal.
